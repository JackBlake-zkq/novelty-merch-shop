    <h1>Welcome to McNally Fans!</h1>
    <p>
        McNally Fans is a work in progress ecommerce platform where you can order custom merchandise
        that pays respects to a beloved Physics teacher, Steven McNally.

        Currently, if you go to the <a href="/#/shop">shop</a> tab, you can select items and make your order ðŸ™Œ
        However, there is currently no system for you to track you package or recieve updates about your order. 
        If you'd prefer to have this, please wait until February 2023. I'll implement these updates as well as 
        major UI changes during my university's winter break.
